Being able to generate all figures and plots for an academic submission
from raw data can be considered the "gold standard" of reproducible
research. [1] By automating the process, it is possible to easily verify
reproducibility at any stage during the analysis. Automation also allows
easy recreation of the entire analysis based on modified inputs or model
assumptions. However, rerunning the entire analysis starting from raw
data soon becomes too time-consuming for interactive use. Caching
intermediate results alleviates this, but introduces the problem of
cache invalidation [2].

R packages offer everything necessary to conduct statistical analyses:
They can store data, code, and written documentation (in the form of
vignettes). Recent efforts have considerably simplified the packaging
process in R, there is first-class support in tools such as RStudio.
This presentation introduces a framework where a statistical analysis is
distributed over several interdependent packages where each serves a
dedicated purpose (e.g., holding raw data, munging data, input
validation, modelling, analysis, reporting, ...). Dependencies between
packages are specified as usual. The framework tracks which downstream
packages [3] need to be rebuilt if a package changes, and allows
updating mutually independent packages in parallel. Interactive work is
possible within the context of each package, while maintaining full
reproducibility [4].


[1] Numerous contributions to the R ecosystem are geared towards this
aim (including but not limited to interfaces to other data formats,
weaving of code and text, and of course the immense variety of
statistical modelling tools)

[2] (which, according to Phil Karlton, is one of the two hard things in
computer science).

[4] (which can be continuously monitored by using version control
systems and continuous integration)
