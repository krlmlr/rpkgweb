Being able to generate all figures and plots for an academic submission
from raw data can be considered the "gold standard" of reproducible
research.[^1] By automating the process, it is possible to easily verify
reproducibility at any stage during the analysis. Automation also allows
easy recreation of the entire analysis based on modified inputs or model
assumptions. However, rerunning the entire analysis starting from raw
data soon becomes too time-consuming for interactive use. Caching
intermediate results alleviates this, but introduces the problem of
cache invalidation[^2].

R packages offer everything necessary to conduct statistical analyses:
They can store data, code, and written documentation (in the form of
vignettes). Recent efforts have considerably simplified the packaging
process in R, there is first-class support in R and RStudio
(and probably in many other environments).
The `rpkgweb` package offers a framework where a statistical analysis can be
distributed over several interdependent packages, each serving a
dedicated purpose (e.g., holding raw data, munging data, input
validation, modelling, analysis, reporting, ...). Dependencies between
packages are specified as usual in the `DESCRIPTION` file.
The framework tracks which downstream
packages[^3] need to be rebuilt if a package changes, and allows
updating mutually independent packages in parallel. Interactive work is
possible within the context of each package, while maintaining full
reproducibility[^4].



[^1]: Numerous contributions to the R ecosystem are geared towards this
aim (including but not limited to interfaces to other data formats,
weaving of code and text, and of course the immense variety of
statistical modelling tools)

[^2]: (which, according to Phil Karlton, is one of the two hard things in
computer science)

[^3]: (reverse dependencies)

[^4]: (which can be continuously monitored by using version control
systems and continuous integration)

- `ProjectTemplate`

- `mvbutils`

- `modules`

- `memoise`

- R blog


## Design goals

- Usability

- Automation

- Reproducibility of results

- Integration with existing infrastructure and workflows

- Interactive processing

- Scalability

- Large datasets

- Caching

- Parallelization

- Conflict resolution


## Framework

- One package, one concern

- Package web: Directory with several packages

- Dependencies via `DESCRIPTION`

- Main verbs
    - `load_all`
    - `test`
    - `bump` (or `uninstall`)
    - `check_up` (= purge revdeps + `test` + `install`)

- Downstream dependencies: `Makefile`

- Additional verbs
    - `document`
    - `check`


## Package organization

- Defining functions: In `R` folder

- Executing code
    - `load_all`
    - `test`
    - `install`

- Raw data
    - As packages
    - `use_data()`
        - own wrapper function

- Validation, checking assumptions
    - Test, perhaps in a child package

- Generating data (munging, intermediate or final results)
    - As variables generated during `build`
    - `use_data()` during `test()`, perhaps in a child package
        - Check `R_TESTS` -> custom "testing" framework that runs
          when started from `devtools` but not with `R CMD check`

- Configuration
    - Perhaps a "base" package all other packages depend upon

- Plots and tables
    - As functions
    - As variables generated during `build`
    - Rendered during `test`

- Documentation
    - As vignettes
    - Inline using `roxygen2`
    - Materialized during `test`
        - Caution: This fails `check` -- no `DESCRIPTION` found
            - Solution: Check `R_TESTS` environment variable, don't build if
              not empty
            - need own wrapper function for `build_vignettes`


## Workflow

### Data preparation

- Start with raw data packages

- Add dependent cleanup and munge data packages

- Add packages that check assertions

Reiterate as necessary!


### Data processing

- Scripts in `R`

- Reiterate with `load_all()`

- Extract functions
    - Document using `roxygen2`

- Extract tests

- If loading/testing a package becomes too slow for interactive work, split it
    1. Package with functions
    2. Another package that caches results of these functions
    3. New package depends on cacher package

Reiterate as necessary!


### Results

- New package

- All results for presentation should be available in dependent packages
    - Plotting and table generation should be fast

- Write documentation in vignettes

- Change upstream packages if further results are needed


## How design goals are achieved

### Usability: Simple concept, packaged in a tested and documented package

### Automation: Generation of a `Makefile`

### Reproducibility: Clean and rebuild

### Integration with existing infrastructure: Package as building block

- RStudio + `devtools`

- Git

- CI systems

- `packrat`

### Interactive processing: Work on one package at a time

### Scalability: Use packages

### Large datasets: Use packages

### Caching: Use packages

### Parallelization: `make -j ...`

## Example: Calibrating a survey


## Other uses

- Package development

- Integration with other `Makefile`-s?
    - dummy file touched when all packages have been installed successfully


## Open questions

- Parametrized builds?
    - More than one `Makefile`


## Limitations

- Whitespace in paths
    - Don't use!


## Summary and outlook

- Package generation must be cheap -- `mason`

- Multi-project IDE -- not yet (RStudio?)

- Constantly switching between `R` and `tests/testthat`
    - `use_testthat_symlink`
